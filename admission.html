<h1>Admmission at <span class="studyabroadnet">Study Abroad net</span></h1>
<p>
Before making any payment, send copies of the data page of your Nigerian passport and your West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination result to our contact addresses below.
</p>
<p>
If your documents are eligible for admission to study Economic Sociology at South-West State University in English, then, you will make the necessary required payments before the University starts preparing invitation for you.
</p>
<p>
After receiving visa, you must enter Russia at least 45 days before your visa expires. It takes at least 30 working days for a new student to be registered by Russian immigration.
</p>

<h1>Our Conditions</h1>

<p>Before applying for a visa, make sure you are travelling to Russia for studies and not for any other purposes.</p>

<p>Study Abroad Net is a non-commercial oriented agency whose aim is to alleviate the frustrations which students who travel abroad to study suffer at the hands of certain greedy agents.</p>

<p>The agency works with volunteers, mainly students studying in Kursk, Russia, who take their pains to travel to Moscow airports to meet new students on arrival and accompany them to South-West State University.</p>

<p>It is humane for the new student to take care of the volunteer transport fare and feeding allowance for the more than 24 hours journey.</p>

<p>You are viewing this site because a programmer has built it for Study Abroad Net (SANET), which pays a web-host company annually. Sequel to this therefore, SANET Agency charges its clients a one-time site maintenance fee.</p>

<p>There is no agent fee for me, the owner of SANET; however, the agency will appreciate any donation made by a student on arrival at the university.</p>

<p>SANET Agency has coordinators and agents in Nigeria who will be there for you until you get your invitation from Russia and visa from its Embassy in Nigeria.
</p>
<h1>Payments Procedures</h1>

<p>    Before the university starts preparing invitation for you, the following payments most be made
</p>
<p>
    Nigerian coordinator or the agent who recruited you: $100.00 or Nigerian Naira equivalent. However, if you come across this site by your own efforts, then this $100.00 is waived for you. Just contact me directly!
</p>
<p>
    After giving the agent the money, scan the receipt confirming the payment and send it to perealbiz@yahoo.com and piterbizano@gmail.com
</p>
<p>
    A transfer of $500.00 to my account. Request for a requisite of my account by writing to perealbiz@yahoo.com and piterbizano@gmail.com
</p>
<ul>
    The breakdown of the $500.00 is:

    <li>SANET site maintenance fee: $100.00</li>

    <li>Courier service fee (DHL) for sending your invitation: $150.00</li>

    <li>Volunteer transport fee and feeding allowance for the journey duration: $150.00</li>

    <li>Your transport fare from Moscow airport to South-West State University: $100.00</li>

    <li>After transferring $500.00 to my account, scan the bank transaction confirmation receipt and send it to perealbiz@yahoo.com and piterbizano@gmail.com</li>
</ul>
Notably, when your invitation is ready I will scan it and send to you to see and be convinced that you have been given admission to study Economic Sociology in English medium. For me to be convinced of your genuine intention to study, you must deposit into my account $1000.00, which is part of your school fee. Your school fee is in Russian Rubble and $2000.00 will take care of it, as well as accommodation fee. The fees will be paid by you on arrival. So, when you arrive at the university we will pay your school and accommodation fees together. 
<p>I am a priest of God and so, would like to deal with only honest students.</p>
<h1>Refund Policy</h1>

<p>If for any reason you are denied visa or you decide to cancel your trip to Russia, even after you have gotten visa, $250.00, which would have taken care of the volunteer transport fare, as well as your own transport fare on arrival, will be refunded immediately to you on your request.</p><p> A letter to this effect must be signed by you and sent to our email addresses. $1000.00 which you transferred to my account as part of your school fee will be as well refunded.
<p>DHL fee is not refundable if an applicant receives his invitation.</p>
